# REAL-TIME-ETL-PIPELINE-FOR-NEWS-DATA-USING-KAFKA-HADOOP-AND-HIVE
This project demonstrates a real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that collects, processes, and analyzes global news articles using a modern big data stack. The pipeline is built using Apache Kafka, Hadoop HDFS, and Apache Hive, and is powered by NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis.
